# guide2golf.github.io

Introduction
The background to my project is that I recently started playing golf and spent a lot of time looking up websites and YouTube to learn more about how to play different shots and to find out more information about golf clubs etc.
The project idea “Guide 2 Golf” is to provide a website for new golfers (beginners) and intermediate and advanced golfers with information on clubs, skills, courses etc. 
The homepage consists of a number of Menus (Courses, Clubs, News, Contact) and also three links from the homepage main frame to access information based on the users golf experience: Beginner, Intermediate or Advanced.
The aim is to give the user tips on which clubs are suitable based on their level and also tips on how to play certain shots. 
It also has details of some of the main courses that they can play in Ireland.

Development of the site.
The tools used to develop the site were:
1.	Wire Frames – Balsamiq. I did some of the screen mock-ups in Figma also, but the final wireframes were done using Balsamiq.
2.	Microsoft Visual Studio was used to code the site.
3.	Photoshop was used for editing images used in the site.
